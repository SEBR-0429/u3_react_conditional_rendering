## Conditional Rendering in React

React is an incredible framework with tremendous power. One of the most powerful parts of working with React is the ability to run conditions on what we render on our screen.

There are a few ways to condtionally render our data
- Ternaries vs If / Else Statements vs Switch Statements
- Rendering Components vs Rendering Data

All of these methods are acceptable to use and will have their own use cases.

Of course, with Props in React, we are able to pass data between multiple components, allowing our pages to appear totally different based on the conditions we're in!


## Ternaries vs If/Else

The main rule to follow is that Ternaries are run *inside* of a return statement, while the return is kept *inside* of our If Else's. 

It looks something like this:
